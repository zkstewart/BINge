# BINge
Clusters de novo transcripts using a reference genome to provide gene-level counts

## Rationale
BINge (BIN Genes for Expression analyses) is designed to enable multi-subspecies differential gene expression analysis,
while making use of multiple reference genomes. It uses a de novo transcriptome assembly representing each subspecies and,
based on the transcript alignments to the genomes, bins sequences (representing putative isoforms from many different subspecies)
into genes. The read alignments can then be summarised per-bin to allow a fair comparison between subspecies.

## How to use
TBD
